      "lived in a castle with her family. She was very kind and generous, and was loved by all the people in the kingdom. One day, she went for a walk in the forest and stumbled upon a magical pond. When she looked into the pond, she saw her reflection transform into a beautiful swan. She was so amazed by the transformation that she decided to make the pond her secret hideaway. Every day, she would go there and sit by the pond, watching the swans and dreaming of her own transformation. \n",

      "One day, a handsome prince happened upon the pond and saw the princess in her swan form. He was so enchanted by her beauty that he asked her to marry him. The princess was hesitant at first, but eventually agreed to be his bride. \n",
